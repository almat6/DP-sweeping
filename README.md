# DP-sweeping
All the Python scripts used for automating reaction parameters and data collection
FindPorts and syringepump, are the nexcessary codes used to find which syringe pump correpsonds to the port of a laptop. 
To conduct the DP-sweep for homopolymer refer to the file: IR_DPsweep.py 
To conduct the DP-sweep for block copolymer refer to the file: IR_DPSweep-BP.py
To process the spectras generated by the FT-IR:
Homopolymer DP-sweep: IR_DataProcessing_DPsweep_4Syringes.py 
Block Copolymer DP-sweep:IR_DataProcessing_DPsweep_4Syringes-BP.py
